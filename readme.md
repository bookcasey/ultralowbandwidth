### Install

Clone this badboy down, climb in that directory, and get your gems in order with `bundle install`

Make sure to set the API keys locally (with bash, for the current shell each time you want to (crumby, I knowâ€”working on it!)):

    export FORECAST_KEY=...

And then run it: `shotgun app.rb`, and lisit `localhost:9393` (probably) in your browser.

### Heroku

Push to heroku with git as normal, then set:

    heroku config:set FORECAST_KEY="...""
